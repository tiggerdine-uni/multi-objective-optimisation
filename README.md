# Multi-Objective Optimisation

The next release problem is a multi-objective optimisation problem that "deals with the selection of a subset of requirements based on their desirability"<sup>[1]([^1])</sup>.

In this assignment, I used the [Platypus](https://platypus.readthedocs.io/) framework to solve this problem in Python. The main challenges were:
 - read data
 - define problem in Platypus
 - plot results
 
 You can read about them in the report, [report.pdf](https://github.com/tiggerdine/multi-objective-optimisation/blob/master/report.pdf).
